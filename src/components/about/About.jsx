      <h3>
        Whilst on maternity leave I tried some online coding challenges to push
        my brain. When my baby stopped sleeping coding had to take a back seat
        but once I got childcare I was able to enrol in an intensive 12week
        Bootcamp in Software Engineering and haven't looked back since.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        With a background in administration I enjoy the methodical and order
        nature of software engineering. I am passionate about solutions for the
        user that enhance their experience.
